GoogleAnalyticsAdvanced
=======================

*Please note* this application does not work with Shiny 0.9 and upwards. I am currently working on updating the application, it will be added to a new repository since this application is designed for use with my book (written with Shiny 0.7) Web Application Development with R using Shiny.

A more advanced version of the Google Analytics application, featuring reactive and conditional UI, animation, and other usability and feature tweaks
